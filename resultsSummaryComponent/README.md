## Overview
-This Project is basically a challenge where a beginner in html and css is challenged to create a design of a
 result summary component and challenge himself/herself to use concepts he/she have learned till now and implementing them practically.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

-Basically I started with just laying out the basic html structure first and then finally styled each and every part of my code as i proceeded further with the design analysis.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Using CSS Media Queries for Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learned how to design a component and make it responsive with the css media queries.

### Continued development

I would love to recreate the project with react and Node.js, Once i have cleared all the javascript concepts and learnd how  the web 2.0 flow works.
